# Machine-Learning

Day 1 of my Data Science journey! Today I explored NumPy — the backbone of numerical computing. Arrays, speed, and clean code. Let’s go! #DataScience

Day 2: Learning how NumPy handles indexing, slicing, and broadcasting. #NumPy #DataScienceJourney

Day 3: Math, stats, and random functions in NumPy. The real magic behind fast operations. #Python #NumPy

Day 4: Matrix multiplication, dot products, and linear algebra with NumPy. Essential ML foundations! #MachineLearning

Day 5: Stepped into Pandas today! DataFrames just made life easier #Pandas #DataAnalysis

Day 6: Clean data = strong models. Learned handling missing values & duplicates. #DataCleaning

Day 7: GroupBy, merge, join — Pandas is insanely powerful!#DataWrangling

Day 8: First step of any project — understand the data. Shape, info, stats… everything matters! #EDA
